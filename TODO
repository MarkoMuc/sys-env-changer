TODO: Prevent it from crashing when description is not present/not formatted correctly
      -> make it so it just gives a warning for those files

TODO: Implement at least some kind of checking, if the new value is actually a possible value for this variable
      -> This can be made optional

TODO: Quite option, where it doesn't print the old value -> or just make current option as the verbose one

TODO: Testing
	-> Add stderr stream
