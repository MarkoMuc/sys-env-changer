TODO: The paths should be read from a file. Make it so multiple config/env variable files can be saved
          -> They get saved in $HOME/.config/senvch/paths.cfg 
	  -> Each path is conjoined with a possible alias "path:alias"
          -> Add a way to display all of them, the user should be able to remove them too
		-> List all paths and alaises "paths -l" or "paths --list"
		-> List all path with matching alias "paths ALIAS"
	  	
		-> A path or just alais can be added with "add PATH[:ALIAS] (PATH[:ALIAS]...)"
		
		-> A path can be deleted with "delete PATH[:ALIAS] (PATH[:ALIAS]...)"
		-> An alais can be deleted with "delete -a ALIAS"
		
		-> An alais can be changed with "change ALIAS ALIAS"
          -> Expand the Help, where it also tells which config. file the variable is connected to

TODO: Only build the full dictionary if needed:
	- When calling HELP
	- When no "-f or --f is added"
TODO: Prevent it from crashing when description is not present/not formatted correctly
      -> make it so it just gives a warning for those files

TODO: Implement at least some kind of checking, if the new value is actually a possible value for this variable
      -> This can be made optional

TODO: Implement a way, where variables can be tabbed in

TODO: Quite option, where it doesn't print the old value -> or just make current option as the verbose one
